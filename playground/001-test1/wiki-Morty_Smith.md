**Mortimer Chauncey** "**Morty**" **Smith Sr.**[[5]](#cite_note-:1-5) is one of the [eponymous](/wiki/Title_character "Title character") [characters](/wiki/Character_(arts) "Character (arts)") from the American [animated television series](/wiki/Animated_television_series "Animated television series") *[Rick and Morty](/wiki/Rick_and_Morty "Rick and Morty")*. Created by [Justin Roiland](/wiki/Justin_Roiland "Justin Roiland") and [Dan Harmon](/wiki/Dan_Harmon "Dan Harmon"), and voiced by the former for the first six seasons of the series,[[1]](#cite_note-Roiland_Departure-1) followed by Harry Belden beginning with the seventh season. Morty is a 14-year-old boy loosely inspired by [Michael J. Fox](/wiki/Michael_J._Fox "Michael J. Fox")'s [Marty McFly](/wiki/Marty_McFly "Marty McFly") from *[Back to the Future](/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_(franchise) "Back to the Future (franchise)")*.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7) Morty is known for his awkward, anxious, second-guessing, doubtful personality, and low sense of self-esteem; the character has been critically well-received. He is the good-natured and impressionable grandson of [Rick Sanchez](/wiki/Rick_Sanchez_(Rick_and_Morty) "Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)"), the son of [Jerry](/wiki/Jerry_Smith_(Rick_and_Morty) "Jerry Smith (Rick and Morty)") and [Beth Smith](/wiki/Beth_Smith "Beth Smith"), the younger brother of [Summer Smith](/wiki/Summer_Smith "Summer Smith"), and the father of [Morty Jr. and Naruto Smith](/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_characters#Relatives_of_the_Smith–Sanchez_family "List of Rick and Morty characters"), who can be easily manipulated. In September 2021, [Jaeden Martell](/wiki/Jaeden_Martell "Jaeden Martell") portrayed Morty in a series of promotional [interstitials](/wiki/Interstitial_television_show "Interstitial television show") for the series.[[2]](#cite_note-JaedenMartell-2)[[3]](#cite_note-JaedenMartell2-3)


An inter-dimensional traveller, several alternate versions of Morty from across the [multiverse](/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction "Parallel universes in fiction") have appeared throughout the [franchise](/wiki/Rick_and_Morty_(franchise) "Rick and Morty (franchise)"). Although initially referring to himself as "Morty C-137" in reference to the designation given to his grandfather by [the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks](/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_characters#Alternate-universe_versions_of_the_main_characters "List of Rick and Morty characters"), in reference to Rick's original universe, "C-137", in "[Rickmurai Jack](/wiki/Rickmurai_Jack "Rickmurai Jack")", Rick is revealed to not be Morty's original Rick, with Morty's true reality designation, [**Morty Prime**](#Biography), being revealed in the [audio commentary](/wiki/Audio_commentary "Audio commentary") for "[Solaricks](/wiki/Solaricks "Solaricks")". Book 1 of the [Oni Press](/wiki/Oni_Press "Oni Press") [*Rick and Morty* comic series](/wiki/Rick_and_Morty_(comics) "Rick and Morty (comics)") (comprising the first two volumes of the series) follows the Rick and [Morty of Dimension **C-132**](#Morty_C-132) (until their deaths in the ["Head-Space" arc](/wiki/Rick_and_Morty_%E2%80%93_Head-Space "Rick and Morty – Head-Space")) while most issues of subsequent installments follow the Rick (C-137) and Morty (Prime) of the television series; the video game *[Pocket Mortys](/wiki/Pocket_Mortys "Pocket Mortys")* follows the Rick and Morty of Dimension **C-123** who capture numerous alternate versions of Morty, including girl counterparts [**Morticia**](#Morticia) and [**Mortabel**](#Mortabel), while various other Mortys are the focus of episodes set in the inter-dimensional [**Citadel of Ricks and Mortys**](#Citadel_of_Ricks_and_Mortys), ruled by **President Morty** of Dimension **79⊢⊇V**, colloquially known as "**Evil Morty**" among fans and the media until the series' [fifth season](/wiki/Rick_and_Morty_(season_5) "Rick and Morty (season 5)"), where this name was officially adopted, whose [origin story](/wiki/Origin_story "Origin story") is explored in the [seventh season](/wiki/Rick_and_Morty_(season_7) "Rick and Morty (season 7)") episode "[Unmortricken](/wiki/Unmortricken "Unmortricken")". The character has received a positive critical reception.[[8]](#cite_note-8)




Characterization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Morty_Smith&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Characterization")]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*[Inverse](/wiki/Inverse_(website) "Inverse (website)")*'s Corey Plante commented that Morty's moral outrage is the basis of many storylines, contrasting with Rick's nihilism. Morty sees morality at a surface level, but his interventions cause disaster and lead to him committing extreme acts of violence. For instance, in "[Mortynight Run](/wiki/Mortynight_Run "Mortynight Run")", Morty rescues a being from assassination but is forced to kill it after discovering that it intends to destroy all carbon-based life.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

Morty seems to be suffering from anxiety and is easily stressed, largely as a result of traumatic experiences during his adventures with Rick. He is often dismissed as idiotic by Rick and others but is shown to be wiser than his grandfather in terms of understanding people's feelings and is capable of explosive anger and moral outrage in objection to Rick's attitude and actions.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7) In "[Rick Potion #9](/wiki/Rick_Potion_No._9 "Rick Potion No. 9")", Morty is forced to abandon his original dimension (the Prime Dimension) and family for Dimension C-131 (where versions of him and Rick have just died) after a "[love potion](/wiki/Love_potion "Love potion")" Rick made for Morty mutated with the [common cold](/wiki/Common_cold "Common cold"), while in "[Raising Gazorpazorp](/wiki/Raising_Gazorpazorp "Raising Gazorpazorp")", Morty's use of a [sex robot](/wiki/Sex_robot "Sex robot") with a "built-in baby-maker" results in him siring a half-alien son, [Morty Junior](/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_characters#Morty_Jr. "List of Rick and Morty characters"), who grows to maturity within the day before going on to write a best-selling book about Morty's raising of him entitled *My (Horrible) Father*.

### Evil Morty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Morty_Smith&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Evil Morty")]


An inter-dimensional traveller and former President of the Citadel of Ricks and Mortys, "**Evil Morty**" of Dimension 79⊢⊇V took control of his Rick with a [mind control](/wiki/Mind_control "Mind control") [eyepatch](/wiki/Eyepatch "Eyepatch") as part of a plot to escape the Central Finite Curve.



### Citadel of Ricks and Mortys[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Morty_Smith&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Citadel of Ricks and Mortys")]


The **[Citadel](/wiki/Citadel "Citadel") of Ricks and Mortys** is an inter-dimensional society populated almost exclusively by alternate versions of Rick and Morty from across the multiverse, founded by Rick C-137, and later ruled by the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks, the Shadow Council of Ricks, and President Morty (Evil Morty). Notable Morty residents include:



* **Mortipper** and **Mortabel Pines–Smith** – [Identical twin](/wiki/Identical_twin "Identical twin") [boy](/wiki/Boy "Boy") and [girl](/wiki/Girl "Girl") [composite versions](/wiki/Composite_character "Composite character") of Morty and the Pines twins [Dipper](/wiki/Dipper_Pines "Dipper Pines") and [Mabel](/wiki/Mabel_Pines "Mabel Pines") from *[Gravity Falls](/wiki/Gravity_Falls "Gravity Falls")*, they are introduced as background characters in "[Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind](/wiki/Close_Rick-counters_of_the_Rick_Kind "Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind")" as [Easter egg](/wiki/Easter_egg_(media) "Easter egg (media)") [cameos](/wiki/Cameo_appearance "Cameo appearance"), before subsequently being named by *Gravity Falls* creator [Alex Hirsch](/wiki/Alex_Hirsch "Alex Hirsch") in April 2017,[[10]](#cite_note-10) and featured as [playable characters](/wiki/Playable_character "Playable character") *[Pocket Mortys](/wiki/Pocket_Mortys "Pocket Mortys")*. After the duo cameoed again in "[The Ricklantis Mixup](/wiki/The_Ricklantis_Mixup "The Ricklantis Mixup")", Mortabel returned on her own in the *[Gravity Falls: Lost Legends](/wiki/Gravity_Falls:_Lost_Legends "Gravity Falls: Lost Legends")* storyline *[Don't Dimension It](/wiki/Gravity_Falls:_Lost_Legends#Don't_Dimension_It "Gravity Falls: Lost Legends")* by Hirsch and Serina Hernandez;[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12) in the storyline, she is depicted as one of the many alternate versions of Mabel trapped in a pocket dimension with the "Mabels of the Multiverse", who join the primary reality Mabel in confronting the Anti-Mabel. Mortabel is next seen in [Rick C-137](/wiki/Rick_Sanchez "Rick Sanchez")'s ["crybaby"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crybaby "wiktionary:crybaby") [backstory](/wiki/Backstory "Backstory") [flashback](/wiki/Flashback_(narrative) "Flashback (narrative)") in "[Rickmurai Jack](/wiki/Rickmurai_Jack "Rickmurai Jack")", in which a younger Rick C-137 had stolen technology from Mortabel's own grandfather, as she had been exiting their family's garage along with her and Mortipper's sister [Summer](/wiki/Summer_Smith "Summer Smith"), and is not present on the Citadel when it is destroyed.[[13]](#cite_note-13)
* **Campaign Manager Morty** – The campaign manager of Candidate (later President) Morty, who is fired before failing to assassinate his former boss.
* **Cop Morty** – An obese and corrupt police officer who [harbors anti-Morty sentiment](/wiki/Internalized_racism "Internalized racism"), and is partnered with a Rookie Rick.
* **Big Morty** – A drug lord who runs a portion of the [criminal underworld](/wiki/Criminal_underworld "Criminal underworld") of **Mortytown**.
* The students of **Morty Academy** – Mortys whose Ricks either died or abandoned them, who are attending the school ahead of being assigned new Ricks. The day before graduation, a group of Mortys led by **Slick Morty** search for the mythical Wishing Portal. On finding it, they decide to sacrifice something important in order to make their wishes come true.

At the conclusion of the storyline, both Rick and Morty C-132 are killed, and their universe destroyed, before the arc pivots to Rick C-137 and Morty Prime (the protagonists of the [*Rick and Morty* television series](/wiki/Rick_and_Morty "Rick and Morty"), and most subsequent volumes of the comic series) who had been watching recordings of their memories as a "movie" from within their C-132 counterparts' now-severed heads.

Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Morty_Smith&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Reception")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The character has received an overall positive reception. VerbStomp described Morty as "Perhaps the picture of childhood innocence, or perhaps the product of parental neglect. Morty is unintelligent, skittish [...] and distressed, likely due to his traumatic experiences while venturing into new worlds with Rick."[[29]](#cite_note-29)
